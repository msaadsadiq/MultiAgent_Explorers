There are 2 types of Multiagents created in this project. 
1. Vaccum Agent
2. Mars Explorer

# Vaccum_Agent

The following program has been written in Java with Java
Development Kit 7. The instructions to run the program are
as follows. I have used Java swing container to visually depict
the grid layout and movement of the agent. The code will
run until the room is cleaned and the agent returns back to
its original position, after that the code will stop.
The code has all the methods and imports all the necessary
libraries. To test the code you only need to copy paste the
code in your IDE of choice as a class and run it.

Running from Command Prompt
1. Run Command Prompt and type
C:\&gt; cd \mywork
C:\mywork&gt; dir
This displays the directory contents.  You should see vaccum.java among the files.
2. C:\mywork&gt; set path=%path%;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_51\bin
This tells the system where to find JDK programs.
3. C:\mywork&gt; javac HelloWorld.java
This runs javac.exe, the compiler.  You should see nothing but the next system prompt...
C:\mywork&gt; dir
4. C:\mywork&gt; java HelloWorld
This runs the Java interpreter.  You should see the program output:
Hello, World!

Running from an IDE for e.g. Eclipse
1. Begin by creating a new Java project File&gt; New&gt;Java Project. You can also use the
shortcut Alt+Shift+N.
2. Enter the project name “vaccumCleaner” and click Finish
3. Start a new Java class. File &gt; New &gt; Class
4. Enter the class name “vaccum” and click Finish
5. Copy &amp; Paste the code below in the code editor
6. Click Save and then press Ctrl+F11 to run the Code



# Mars Explorer
The following program has been written in Java
